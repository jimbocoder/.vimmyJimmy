After way too many years, this is my attempt to formalize and finally decide on a minimal set of portable vim configurations that I can use across all the servers in my life.

### Requirements
 - https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim
 - `suan/vim-instant-markdown` is included but requires a couple things first:
   1. sudo gem install pygments.rb redcarper
   1. sudo npm install -g instant-markdown-d
